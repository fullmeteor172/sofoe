Sofoe was born out of my passionate hatred for the Sophos login portal. I hated having to open it every time I wanted to connect to the internet, I hated that I had to keep that tab open for it to work, I hated how clunky to whole UX felt. Sofoe is my solution to it.

Running this script will keep you logged into the WiFi. If the Uni's WiFi goes down (which it does way too often) it'll attempt to log you back in as soon as it can. You can also temporarily pause this and logout too.

This will work in **ALL** the buildings on campus, the MH's, LH's and all Academic Blocks with seamless transition from one to the other

### Features

- [x] Internet can stay up even if the script is closed

- [x] Logs events to make troubleshooting easy in `app.log`
- [x] Auto-detects URL for the Login Portal
- [x] Doesn't break if you connect to a different network
- [x] Light-Weight and Fast
- [x] Cross-Platform code
- [ ] Choice to pick between emulating a desktop or mobile client
